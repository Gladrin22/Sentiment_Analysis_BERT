# Sentiment_Analysis_using_BERT
Analyzing and understanding  the users or customers emotions using pre-trained model [BERT] Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Rating the dataset(Reviews , feedack etc ...) between the scale of (1-5) . In this (1) stands for the worst and (5) stands for the best . 


# What is BERT ?
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.BERT is the state of the art language model for NLP . This is a transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. Yes , its a pre-trained ! model devleoped in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. For , more details check out the reference below .

# What is a transformer ?
The Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.
